# DATA608 FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL

## VISUALIZING CRIME AND WIFI HOTSPOTS IN NYC OVER TIME

For my final project, I am interested in building visualizations using the following data:

### NYC Hotspot Locations 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Wi-Fi-Hotspot-Locations/yjub-udmw

### NYC Arrest Data 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u

The proposed dashboard will visualize wifi hotspot locations and crime data, including a geomap with a slider to view results over time, including, possibly --hopefully-- a time lapse visualization. The goal is to prepare visualizations which offer insight into the relationship between the installation/accessibility of wifi hotspot locations and crime data. My research question is, does the presence of wifi hotspots affect arrest rates? Such a relationship would be invaluable to government agencies in budget allocation for future projects. 

This project will use Shiny and Leaflet in R amongst other packages.
